    "1. Describes the project. If you are doing a predefined project choice, explain how you\n",
    "implemented that specific choice. This description should match what you submitted as\n",
    "your project proposal. (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a \"Menu Ordering System.\" The instructions were presented on Canvas, and a proposal was written explaining my interest in this idea. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of the programming experience in this project where I first wrote a proposal, wrote pseudocode in which I would explore the concepts I may need to incorporate, did some research on specific syntaxes that were unfamiliar to me, and wrote the code through a trial/error process. I did include exception handling techniques mainly through the use of conditionals and try/except statements. I am sure there are more efficient ways of writing this \"Menu Ordering System,\" but this implementation covered the topics I am comfortable with writing in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explains in a few sentences why you selected this project, and if you learned what you had\n",
    "hoped to learn by doing this project (from your proposal). Explain. (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected this project because I felt familiar with the concepts I could potentially write code for. In my proposal, I mentioned that I planned to implement conditionals, try/except statements, and user-defined functions, which I included quite extensively. I also learned more about sequence data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and strings (iterable objects). I used what I learned in a previous coding assignment where appending items to an empty data structure could be done through the use of a for loop several times. It is a good practice to think deeply about concepts learned, and connect those ideas to a real-world item much like this project idea entailed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What you would do differently if you were to have an opportunity to redo this project and why.\n",
    "(4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice to myself after completing this project is that I should be careful to introduce concepts I don't know much about. I believe I do a good job of minimizing concepts that are unfamiliar to me in this project. It would be a past practice of mine where I felt my understanding of a concept was not adequate because I did not explore the additional functionality or methods of that particular concept. I am now finding that it is better to explain or write everything I know about a concept, and then consult additional sources to fill in the gaps. For example, if I were to research the methods of lists, I would not want to explore each and every list method and see how it fits into my project needs. Instead, I should explore a small handful of methods and try to think deeply about each method: the input, the arguments, the output. Perhaps envision different scenarios I could implement the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had an opportunity to redo this project, I would start writing pseudocode as soon after I wrote the proposal. I would've made the pseudocode as extensive as possible. You could explore different ways to write your code in the planning process more so than in the actual coding process. Also, I would have read more articles and watched videos on menu ordering systems in Python, and summarized some of the main points I learned from those videos.\n",

    "4. How to run your project. (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The user has 3 options at the start--ordering, entering manager mode, or entering specials. To order, the user is prompted to first enter appetizers. The user can enter as many appetizers as they want, but one-at-a-time. The user doesn't have to enter anything in the appetizers, and just write 'done' to complete the appetizer order. The user is then prompted to enter the main entrees, desserts, and drinks in the same fashion used to enter items as the appetizers. The user is then asked if they have completed their order. If the user selects yes, they are presented with a receipt that includes a bill, sales tax, a bill after taxes, and a thank you for their purchase. If the user selects no, they have the option to edit any of their course orders, but they will have to re-enter all the items in that specific course. Note, editing a course negates the chosen items that were selected for that course by the user previously, and only the most up-to-date course orders are included in the bill. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the user enters manager mode, they are prompted to either add items to the course menus or remove items from the course menus. The course displays the menu after each update made by the manager. If the user enters the specials option, they have four options. Depending on which option they choose, they can specify certain items already in the menu as specials, specify certain items not in the menu as specials, or remove items from the specials. The manager can then hand over to the user who can then make an order with specials available to order from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is explained in paragraph comments throughout the code.\n",

    "5. Was the project challenging in the way you expected? What did you overcome? (4 points)\n",

    "This project was challenging in the way that I experienced a lack of confidence in writing code. I would see this project as a daunting task to fulfill. To overcome this feeling, I started small. I looked at a concept, and I thought, what could I explain about that specific concept?

    "\"\"\"A Menu Ordering System:\n",
    "Design a menu ordering system for a restaurant. It should include a fully-featured response set\n",
    "to user inputs.\n",
    "Your menu ordering system should, at a minimum, do the following (up to -5 points if a given\n",
    "requirement is not fulfilled):\n",
    "1. Prompt an individual to order food until they indicate the order is complete.\n",
    "2. A user should be able to order from the menu. Think of what this means for usability.\n",
    "3. Apply prices, update the list of items ordered and a running total, and be able to repeat\n",
    "the ordered items back to the “customer” at any point prior to the order being finished.\n",
    "4. Once the order is finalized, present the “customer” with a bill, including sales tax as a\n",
    "separate line, a nicely formatted summary/receipt, and thank the individual for their\n",
    "purchase.\n",
    "5. All prices must be written in dollar format, so for example an item for $1.50 should not be\n",
    "listed as ‘1.5’ or “15.000.”\n",
    "6. If an item is ordered more than once, both the list of ordered items when displayed to the\n",
    "user and the receipt will show that as additive. For example, if a soda is $1.25 and the\n",
    "customer orders two, it should reflect something like ‘Soda - 2 - $2.50’. The specific\n",
    "formatting is up to you.\n",
    "7. Allow a “manager mode” that adds new items to the menu with pricing, so users could\n",
    "then order them. Manager mode should also allow deletions of items. Remember\n",
    "usability and error handling here.\n",
    "8. All manager mode tasks should have a confirmation step that double checks the new\n",
    "inputs.\n",
    "9. Manager mode allows the manager to designate some items as ‘specials.’ This means\n",
    "that the manager can make specials out of existing items or new items, and be able to\n",
    "remove existing items from the ‘special’ designation. The customer should be able to\n",
    "see the list of specials and order them.\n",
    "10. Extra credit: manager mode could also allow editing of previously entered items, for the\n",
    "ambitious managers among you. (+5 points).\"\"\""
